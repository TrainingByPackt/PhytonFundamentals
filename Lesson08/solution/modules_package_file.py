        This function is the main entry point to trigger the other functions to handle file operations. First, we call
        the `read_mailing_list_file` to read the original dataset and process it with the `update_mailing_list`
        function. Then, we cache the resulting active users ids list.

        Next, we call the `save_output_file` function to persist the users ids to an output csv file.

        Finally, we compute the length of the output file to check if it matches the result of our previous function
        to update the mailing list.

        To call this function, we need to provide some parameters: `filename`, `output_filename` and the `io_mode`.

        In order to play with the different i/o operations in python, we are going to send the io_mode parameter as a
        list ['r+', 'w+'] with the reading/writing operations separately. We could have done this with a single
        file operation, though.

        Example:

            mailinglist_validation_util('mailing_list.csv', 'output.csv', ['r+', 'w+'])

    :param filename: the name of the original dataset. In our case it's `mailing_list.csv`.
    :param output_filename: the name of the output file with the persisted ids for the active users. In our case
    it's `output.csv`.
    :param io_mode: array with the file operations for each function (`read_mailing_list_file` and `save_output_file`).
    :return: the length of the output file.

    """

    # Call the function to read the original mailing list file and cache the results from the function
    updated_mailing_list = read_mailing_list_file(filename, io_mode[0])

    # Call the function to write the results back to a csv file
    save_output_file(updated_mailing_list, output_filename, io_mode[1])

    # The sum of lines for the output file could have been done this way as well. Considering we are passing a list
    # of the active users ids to persist, and there is no processing in between, we could call `len()` directly on the
    # list we are passing to the `save_output_file` function.
    # output_file_length = (len(updated_mailing_list))

    # Open output file to count the number of lines written

    # Sum 1 for each line of the output file
    output_file_length = (sum(1 for _ in output_file))
